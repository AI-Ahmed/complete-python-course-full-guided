# completed_python_course
My directory leads to my folders and files that contain .py projects and code file in which will help the other py beginners to work and interact with python from A-Z.  Thanks to Mr Tim Buchalka for teaching me this course in 2019. It was a good journey. And I'm still taking it as a guide into my work. I've learned a lot from this course besides I predict that this course will qualify me to go deep into my Blockchain Career perfectly without having any naps or gaps.
