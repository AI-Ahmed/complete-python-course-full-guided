# What's the Database?
     
"""A database is just an organised collection of data that can be used to store
   information on a computer or accessed from a web server over the internet
   
   Vendors such as Microsoft, Oracle and IBM produce database management system DBMS
   based on "Relational Database. Data is stored in rows and columns, with a row
   corresponding to a single record and the columns representing the fields that make up
   a record - such as name, address and data of birth in the case of a person's record; or
   stock number, description and quantity in a stock keeping application.
   
   These traditional databases typically use Structured Query Language (SQL or Sequel)
   for performing operations such as querying and updating the data, but there is now
   a growing interest in NoSQl databases used for storing and processing "Big Data".
   
   Android includes a public domain database engine called "SQLite", and Python includes
   support for SQLite databases in the Standard Library. Unlike traditional database management systems
   such as SQL server or Oracle, SQLite is completely self-contained and doesn't need a separate server to run on.
   
   SQLite was designed to be embedded into system - originally missile guidance systems. It uses the SQL
   language, which makes it very easy to use if you already know a bit about databases and means that you can
   move on to use other SQL databases once you have learnt to use SQLite. 
   
   Interestingly, text messages on an iPhone are also stored in an SQLite database.
